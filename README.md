# Tasks for practical work with mathematical problems in the C programming language and their solution

## 1. Area of the triangle
The user enters three numbers - the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Find the area of the triangle. Make a check for the existence of a triangle (for example, 1, 2, 3 - there is no such triangle).

## 2. The quadratic equation
Prepare a program for calculating the real roots of a quadratic equation based on the entered coefficients

📁 Code: [`Solution in second.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/tasks_math_c/blob/main/second.c)

## 3. The cubic equation
Prepare a program for calculating the roots of a cubic equation based on the entered coefficients.

## 4. Exchanging the values of two variables
Write a program for exchanging the values of two variables.

📁 Code: [`Solution in fourth.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/tasks_math_c/blob/main/fourth.c)

## 5. Exchanging the values of two variables without using the third one
Write a program for exchanging the values of two variables without using the third one.

## 6. Exponentiation of a 
The number a is given. Without using any arithmetic operations other than multiplication, get a) a4 in two operations, b) a6 in three operations, c) a15 in five operations.

## 7. Exponentiation without pow
Enter valid a and x, calculate a to the power of X. Do not use the sw function.

## 8. Passing the brick through the hole
Write a program that should determine whether a brick will fit into the hole. The size of the hole (length and height) is entered by the user. The same applies to the dimensions
of the brick, the user enters the values of the length, width and height of the brick into the program.

📁 Code: [`Solution in seventh.c`](https://github.com/Liloika/tasks_math_c/blob/main/eighth.c)

## 9. The max and min digits in a number
Organize the input of a two-digit natural number from the keyboard. The program must determine the smallest and largest digits that are part of a given natural number.
