# Tasks for practical work with mathematical problems in the C programming language and their solution

## 1. Area of the triangle
The user enters three numbers - the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Find the area of the triangle. Make a check for the existence of a triangle (for example, 1, 2, 3 - there is no such triangle).

## 4. Exchanging the values of two variables
Write a program for exchanging the values of two variables.

## 6. Exponentiation of a 
The number a is given. Without using any arithmetic operations other than multiplication, get a) a4 in two operations, b) a6 in three operations, c) a15 in five operations.
