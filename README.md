# Tasks for practical work with mathematical problems in the C programming language and their solution

## 1. Area of the triangle
The user enters three numbers - the lengths of the sides of the triangle. Find the area of the triangle. Make a check for the existence of a triangle (for example, 1, 2, 3 - there is no such triangle).
